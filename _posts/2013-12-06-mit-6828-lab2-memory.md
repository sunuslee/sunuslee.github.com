##Lab2

这个Lab主要是编写内核内存管理的代码:

1. 初始化物理内存, 并实现物理页的**alloc** **free**.
2. 建立页目录, 页表的两层结构并设置权限.
3. 编写页基本操作的代码, **创建** / **查询** / **插入** / **删除**.
4. 按需求初始化各个段的内存, 分配 **kernel / user** 的权限.

接下来, 我们一点一点的说完成该Lab需要注意的一些地方.

###Part 1

> Physical Page Management
>
> The operating system must keep track of which parts of physical RAM are free and which are currently in use. JOS manages the PC's physical memory with page granularity so that it can use the MMU to map and protect each piece of allocated memory.
>
> You'll now write the physical page allocator. It keeps track of which pages are free with a linked list of struct PageInfo objects, each corresponding to a physical page. You need to write the physical page allocator before you can write the rest of the virtual memory implementation, because your page table management code will need to allocate physical memory in which to store page tables.
